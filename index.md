### ABOUT

I am a PhD student in the [IDEALAB PhD program](https://phd-idealab.com/), based at the University of Potsdam in Germany and Macquarie Univeristy in Sydney, Australia. I study how adults learn, retain, consolidate and/or forget words in their first and later-acquired languages. For instance, I am interested in how different aspects of the word learning process are affected by the context in which novel words are trained. My research interests also concern the interplay between the episodic and semantic memory systems at different stages of word meaning acquisition, and how this is influenced by familiarity/novelty of new information compared to pre-existing knowledge. I also have a keen interest in the role of sleep and age-related processes in word learning. I use behavioral and electrophysiological methods to examine this. I am also very enthusiastic about statistics.

My amazing supervisors are [Lyndsey Nickels](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/lyndsey-nickels) from MQ and [Audrey BÃ¼rki](https://audreyburki.github.io/Website/) from UP.
